# NetWorm_Py3

Python worm that spreads across local networks.

The worm tries to brute-force root login data and spreads via SSH/SFTP. 
It can be used to measure worm propagation in test networks without real malware. 
The worm has been developed for the evaluation of an MTD (Moving Target Defense) network. 
It is part of a Masterâ€™s thesis project at LMU and UniBw M:
[Evaluation of network-level Moving Target Defense Strategies](http://www.nm.ifi.lmu.de/teaching/Ausschreibungen/Diplomarbeiten/ma-network-mtd/)
